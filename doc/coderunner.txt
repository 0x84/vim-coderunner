What is the CodeRunner?
    CodeRunner is the best way to write code on your Mac. You can run code 
    in almost any language instantly, and you'll be surprised by the powerful
    set of features in such a lightweight and easy-to-use editor.

This simple plugin aims to mimic that, and i have used some scripts from
CodeRunner.

USAGE                                           *vim-coderunner-usage*
